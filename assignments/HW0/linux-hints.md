  - **Notice For Linux User**: 
    If you are on Linux (especially Ubuntu), you might NOT get the latest version (`GHC 8.6.3` and `cabal 2.4.1.0`) by following the instruction on Haskell Platform.
    Although the older version of GHC probably will not be a problem for this course, 
    please note that your code will be tested on GHC version 8.6.3.
    Here are two of the options to get the latest version of GHC: [ghcup](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup) and [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
