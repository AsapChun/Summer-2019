## REPL hints
* `:load` or `:l` will change the module you are inspecting
* `:reload` or `:r` will reload the file.  Do this often!
* `:type` or `:t` will tell you the type of an expression
* `:quit` or `:q` will leave the repl

## ```git``` issues
If you are having ```git``` issues, run ```git status``` and cut and paste it into a private message on GitHub for Mark.
